<h1 class="title"> Hello, I'm Tulsi</h1>

<img src="me.png" width="30%" height="auto" align="right">

<p> I go to Yale University and I created my own major called DIGITAL AGE STUDIES. 
<br><br>
	I study the Internet and technology from socio-cultural perspectives and use that knowledge to inform my design practices. I imagine a digital world that is truly creative, where imagination is consistently pushing boundaries.
<br><br>
	I'm a big fan of circles and blobby shapes. I love coffee but can't drink more than one cup a day. My favorite color is green. And I have synesthesia. 
<br><br>
	This site is just a small peek into the work I've done. If you're curious to see more, visit my more informal site: <a href="https://www.moonbasil.net/"> moonbasil.net</a> or <a href = "mailto: tulsikpatel2000@gmail.com">email me</a>!

<br><br> <p> Here's what some people have said about me: </p>
<br><br>
<h1> Tulsi is... <br>
		- Creative: Tulsi comes up with new ideas, thoughts and ways of approaching things<br>
        - Fearless: Tulsi is never afraid to speak up, contribute and address something<br>
        - Proactive: Tulsi truly shows up to what she is invited to, and is always looking to do more and to explore more<br>
