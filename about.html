<div class="intro">
<p> I go to Yale University and I created my own major called DIGITAL AGE STUDIES. 
<br><br>
	I study the Internet and technology from socio-cultural perspectives and use that knowledge to inform my design practices. My mind lives at the intersection of technology and philosophy. I imagine a digital world that is truly creative, where imagination is consistently pushing boundaries and critical thought is integral to the process. 
<br><br>
	I'm a big fan of circles and blobby shapes. I love coffee but can't drink more than one cup a day. My favorite color right now is green. And I made this site from scratch! 
<br><br>
	This site is just a small peek into the work I've done. If you're curious to see more, visit my more informal site: <a href="https://www.moonbasil.net/"> moonbasil.net</a> or <a href = "mailto: tulsikpatel2000@gmail.com">email me</a>!

<div class="agnesreview">
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: nk57;"> Creative, well-spoken, collaborative, and insightful. <br>
I worked with Tulsi on a research project at CNN Underscored. Her research compilation was so effective that it would remain a pattern to follow. <br>
Tulsiâ€™s super strength is her openness to tackle projects big and small. She brings energy, freshness, intellect, and a creative spark. Working with Tulsi has been a pleasure, and I can't wait to see what she'll tackle next!<br>

<div class="andrewreview">
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: nk57;"> Tulsi is one of those people that just get it. Her ability to find deeper meaning amidst a sea of noise is unparalleled, and her seemingly intuitive understanding of human behavior is scarily on point. The work she did with us at dcdx over a year ago as an intern still stands the test of time as some of our most thought-provoking and loved writing from our audience.<br>
