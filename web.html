        <p class="explanation" > This start-up app is creating a media sharing social platform. Users can share their favorite songs, videos, and podcasts similarly to how they would tweet. They reached out to me for some help cleaning up their UX. Below are some of my sketched recommendations. I also worked on Figma to create so higher-fidelity prototypes.</p><br>

 	<h1 style="font-size:60px; color: blue; font-family: nk57; "> Yale RideShare App (Yuber) </h1> <br>
 	<h3> PROBLEM </h3>
 		<p class="explanation" > Students need a way to get from the airport to campus (and vice versa). Most options are expensive so the optimal strategy is to share a ride and split the cost.
 			<br>
 			Currently, most students use the Yale RideShare Facebook Group. The problem is that this group is not private and overloaded with text. It's difficult to dig through all of the posts to find someone with a similar ride schedule to you. On top of that, you may receive spam comments if you post. </p> <br>
 		<div class="fb">
 			<img src="facebook.png" width="60%" height="auto">
 			<img src="spam.png" width="30%" >
 		</div>
			<br>

 		<p class="explanation"> There have been attempts at creating apps to solve these problems. <br>
 			The first app is Ride Buddies, which requires a Yale login. While this solves the issue of privacy, the app design is poor and not well-marketed.<br>
 			The other app is called Hopp. While this app has a more sophisticated interface, it is not Yale-specific enough. App store reviews explain that it is difficult to actually find a ride match.</p>

 		</div>

	<br>

 		<h3> MY SOLUTION </h3>
 		<p class="explanation"> An app that offers privacy and specificity while using familiar interface styles. <br>
 		I designed an app called Yale RideShare, which essentially combines interface elements from social apps, dating apps, and carpooling app. I was inspired by the booking features of Uber and Lyft, but I also wanted to incorporate the "matching" feature of Tinder and Bumble. Lastly, I wanted there to be a feed as there is on social media and the Facebook group. But this feed should look clean. </p>

 			<img src="profile.png" width="30%" >
 		</div>
 		<br>
 		<h3> WIREFRAMING </h3>
 		<p class="explanation"> I used Procreate to start sketching ideas for what the app would look like.</p>

 		<h3> PROTOTYPING </h3>
 		<p class="explanation"> I used Figma to create a higher fidelity design and start prototyping. Below is the prototype. Click through to get an idea of what the experience would be like.</p>

<br>
 		<h3> FUTURE DIRECTION (theoretically) </h3>
 		<p class="explanation"> If this app were to launch, marketing would be the most important piece of the puzzle. I have extensive experience in marketing, both professionally and at Yale, and could utilize graphic design skills to creatively market this campaign.
